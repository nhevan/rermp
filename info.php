hello

MUST KEEP IN MIND
=================
1.all the "cratedBy" are now set to 1, it must be replaced with appropriate userId after ACL is implemented
2.all the hidden fields are being transferred to the controller for safety issues
3."USERTYPES" must be changed in UsersController after acl implementation and according to final DB
